### Nhi B Yen/배연이
I'm an Information Technology student at VNU University of Engineering and Technology and will attend Sungkyunkwan University in the Fall semester, 2022. 
My intended major is Software Engineering.

I was an image-processing collaborator of RikkeiSoft, Hanoi. Now I'm working as a home tutor and a part-time SEO writer. 

I do love reading books, especially fiction. You can see my votes and reviews on 
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/longlivebuinhi) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/keepmysadnessaway/).

I also grow a Youtube channel about my 12 years of self-studying and another one for shitposting only :D Just check them out:
